# protein

In creating an interactive data visualization, I chose ot focus on the nutritional composition of protein/meal bars. This consisted of compiling nutrition information from nearly 100 bars of the most popular brands, two flavors from each line, to allow users to compare contents.

Created with HTML, CSS, and JS/jQuery.
